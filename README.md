# Retail-Store-Sales-Prediction

The aim is to build a predictive model to find out the sales of each product at a particular store so that it would help the decision makers to find out the properties of any product or store, which play a key role in increasing the overall sales. 
The data collected has about 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Now each product has certain attributes that sets it apart from other products. Same is the case with each store. 
Forecast analysis along with data visualization is performed to find the sales across many stores, and also which products are more sold, and hence increasing the sales. According to the characteristics of the data, we can use the method of multiple linear regression analysis  Random Forest ,XGBoost and Support Vector Machine (SVR) algorithms to forecast the sales volume.  
A very first step we collected data of different stores , and started working on gatered data . Initially we should understand our raw data thoroughly, i.e., we should explore the no. of features/columns and rows, datatype of the features, feature names and so on. It helps in working with the data in the next stages.

Data 
There are two 2 CSV files — Train, Test. 
• The Train file contains 11 independent variables and 1 target variable, i.e., Item_Outlet_Sales.
• The Test file also contains the same set of independent variables, but there is no target variable because that is what we have to predict.
